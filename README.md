## purpose
This assignment will help you understand the MVC model and how to implement it into a application.  

## task
* If you don't understand what MVC is or how to use it make sure you watch the class lectures and read the articles I posted in the Homework 2 overview.
* You will be creating an application that is set up the way I have shown you for a simple MVC project. 
* Make sure you use npm to create your project and that you have a package.json fileReadme file and put the link to Web 4 inside the Readme file.
* ou need to create four links in the navigation that when clicked on display that pages information in the content area of the site. (So when I click on about link the information that was on the page goes away and the about information is put in its place).
* You can create any page and design that you like but you must have four pages and they must contain images and text. Lorem is fine to use.
* Upload this to the web 4 server and to Github as well. Remember to add to. your Readme file and put the link to Web 4 inside the Readme file.
* Submit the Github link to this assignment.
